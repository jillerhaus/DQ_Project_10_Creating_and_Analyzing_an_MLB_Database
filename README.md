# DataQuest Project 10:  Designing and Creating an SQL database

This is the tenth project I completed in the "Data Analyst in Python" and "Data Scientist in Python" paths from Dataquest. In this project data contained in several `CSV` files was combined to make a preliminary `SQL` database. This database was then normalized. The project's focus is on both creating and normalizing a database. It was very time-intensive, but a lot was learned in the project.

## Prerequisites

This project requires both the Jupyter notebook as well as the `CSV` files containing the raw data to be put into the database. There are also two picture files, containing the schema diagram used for normalizing the database.

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need `Jupyter Notebooks` with a python 3 kernel to be installed on your machine. Instructions on how to install `Jupyter Notebooks` can be found on the [Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org/install).

The project itself is written in Python 3 and uses the modules `Numpy`, `Pandas`, `Seaborn`, `sqlite3` and `matplotlib` to run. These can be installed by running `pip install <name of module>` in the console.
